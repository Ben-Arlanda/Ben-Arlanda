ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben, a Software Engineer with a background in Software Engineering Recruitment. 

## ðŸ‘€ About me 

I have always been a naturally curious and creative person which is why I decided to follow my passions, changing careers to become a Software Engineer to craft and develop meaningful digital experiences!

On a personal level I consider myself to be a great listener. I have a strong EQ with a growth mindset and passion for human behaviour and mental health. 

I'm excited about leveraging my blend of soft skills and technical expertise to make a positive impact to people lives alongside a great team.
